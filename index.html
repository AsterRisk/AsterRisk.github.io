            <p class = bio>My name is Kyle Burke. I was born on the 29th of June 2000 and I am an aspiring game designer. I attended Campion College from 2011 to 2018 and hope to graduate from UWI Mona with my B. Sc. in Computer Science in 2021. Growing up, I spent an inordinate amount of time on computers. I always thought it was so cool how I could be in Jamaica and interact with my cousins overseas, or play games with strangers I'd never even met. I made a lot of memories on chat rooms and websites like reddit before realising I was definitely going into a career in IT. To date, I've amassed a large amount of experience and skills in this field, and I'm always excited to learn more. Outside of IT, my hobbies include music, tae-kwon-doe and reading.
